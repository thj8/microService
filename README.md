# MicroService

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thj8/microService.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thj8/microService)

In this course, you will learn how to quickly spin up a reproducible development environment with Docker to manage a number of microservices. Once the app is up and running locally, you’ll learn how to deploy it to an Amazon EC2 instance.

根据[国外的课程](https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/)改变而来。
